# Postmarks browser extension

A browser extension to send things to your [Postmarks](https://postmarks.glitch.me) instance.

WIP. It sort of works.
It looks like Firefox doesn't support background service workers / there is Manifest v3 stuff going on I haven't looked into properly. Probably needs a polyfill and/or a specific version.

As yet unpackaged, works in MS Edge, Chrome etc.
